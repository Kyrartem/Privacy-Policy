<p>Effective Date: 2025-08-18</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is provided by Tono Apps (an independent developer team). The terms &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, and &ldquo;our&rdquo; mean Tono Apps. The terms &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; refer to any individuals and entities who use our Services (the mobile application and related features).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
<p>We do not ask you to provide traditional contact details (such as your name, postal address, email, or phone number) to use the Application. If you contact us voluntarily (e.g., by email), we will receive and use that personal data only to respond to your inquiry.</p>
<p>The Application and its integrated third-party SDKs may automatically collect certain information when you download and use it, including (as applicable):</p>
<ul>
<li>your device&rsquo;s Internet Protocol address (IP address);</li>
<li>in-app pages you visit, timestamps, session duration;</li>
<li>time spent in the Application;</li>
<li>device and OS information (device model, OS version).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Application does not collect precise location data.</p>
<p>Advertising ID and device identifiers are used for advertising and measurement. Users can limit ad personalization or reset their Advertising ID in the device settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Access and Partners</strong></p>
<p>We may share limited data with service providers that help us operate the Application (e.g., advertising, analytics, crash reporting).</p>
<p>Where we share reporting or metrics externally, we do so in aggregated (statistically summarized) and de-identified/anonymized form (with direct identifiers removed and not reasonably linkable back to a person). We do not sell users&rsquo; personal data. We do not share data with third parties unrelated to our Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third-party services used by the Application may include (as applicable):</p>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/9037938?hl=en">Google Play Services</a></p>
<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> (analytics, crash reporting)</p>
<p><a href="https://admob.google.com/home/">Google AdMob</a> / <a href="https://unity.com/ru/products/unity-ads">Unity Ads</a> / <a href="https://www.applovin.com/">AppLovin</a> / <a href="https://www.multiadaptor.com/work/vungle/">Vungle</a> / <a href="https://cas.ai/">CAS.AI</a> (advertising/mediation)</p>
<p>Each third-party provider processes data under its own privacy policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Opt-Out Rights</strong></p>
<p>You can stop all collection by the Application by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process on your device or the app marketplace. You can also limit ad personalization or reset your Advertising ID in the device settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Data Retention</strong></p>
<p>We retain non-confidential user data for the duration of your use of the Application. Data may be deleted upon your request or due to technical reasons (e.g., storage rotation, system maintenance). Retention periods for analytics and crash data may also depend on the settings of our third-party SDKs and partners.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect information we process and maintain, including encryption in transit (TLS/HTTPS), access controls, and procedural safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
